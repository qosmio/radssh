RadSSH plugin *tar
Helper to simplify collecting files from remote hosts
by tar'ing (and optionally compressing) them prior to transfer.
Instead of using 'cat', as *get does, the remote command is 'tar'
with options to feed the resulting tar file contents to stdout
where RadSSH can write local files with the stdout buffer content.
